# Machine-Learning

This is one of the courses I took. In this repository, I just uploaded the final project I did with my team member, named 'Final-Project-Group5'. It is similar with the repository 'Final-Project-Group5'. In this repo, I just uploaded my own project part so that I won't change the results made by the whole team. And it will be eaiser for people to have a look on my work here.

What's more, I will upload more relative machine learning knowledge or code, and improve my project later...

PS: Thanks for my course professor Amir, he is a great professor! It was he who opened the door for me to study data science and made me very interested in it. Here, many of the materials I will upload here coming from him. Here is his Github: [Amir-Jafari](https://github.com/amir-jafari).
