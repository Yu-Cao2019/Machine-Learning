## Code
This folder includs three file -- 'project_group5.py', 'datasets_HousingData.csv' and 'README.md'.  
'project_group5.py' contains all code that we write to do the project. Please run it if you want to see the results.  
'datasets_HousingData.csv' is the original data. If you want to run the code, please download this file too.
'README.md' shows the order of code and a shor description of what each script does.  
*Note*: Due to time consuming, 'RandomizedSearchCV' part is marked as comment in 'project_group5.py', we directly use its running results.
If you want to check the results, you can run it in Individual-Final-Report/Yu-Cao/Code/RandomizedSearchCV_Neural_Network.py.
